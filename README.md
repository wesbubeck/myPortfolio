# Overview

    * This is webpage dedicated to my portfolio. It is written in HTML CSS and JavaScript. The styling is done in Google's Materializes CSS. Page is mobile friendly. It includes my bio in a modal that opens through a button click. Links to navigate the page are on a side bar on the right handside. The hamburger on the top left hand side of the page will open a side bar that include links to github, linkedin, and link to email or call me. Technologies that I am most comfortable with are displayed in a carousel. **Note MaterializeCSS needed to be alter to make Carousel "finger swipe" work in mobile.
